## Questions

Phenotypic differences between gene knockouts (*e.g.*, via mutations) and gene knockdowns (*e.g.*, via RNAi or morpholinos) are often attributed to off-target effects of the RNA-interference reagents. However, genetic compensation (*e.g.*, via transcriptional adaptation) offers an alternative explanation.

1. Explain the concept of **transcriptional adaptation**.
2. How can the phenomenon of transcriptional adaptation be **distinguished from** off-target
RNAi or morpholino effects?
3. Propose **alternative models** by which transcriptional adaptation can be achieved. How
would you distinguish between them?
4. Propose an experiment to further test your model.
